# Conference Management System

Conference Management application is built with MERN stack, and utilizes third party API's. This CMS enable three main different implementations:

1. A reviewer of the conference logs into their online account and can view the list of papers assigned
to them to review. For each paper they see: paper title, authors, keywords, abstract, pdf
attachment, and name of author that submitted the paper.
2. The reviewer has the option to enter a review for a paper. Details to enter are: overall score (2
accept to -2 reject), review details, private comments to other reviewers and conference
organizers. The reviewer can save their review in draft format for future editing. When the reviewer
clicks submit on their review, they cannot make further edits to the review.
3. When a reviewer submits their review for a paper, they can see the other reviews already
submitted for the paper. Their review is also visible to other reviewers who have already submitted
a review; but hidden from those who have not yet submitted their review
